## 📌 Features

- ✨ Accepts JSX/HTML/JS/TSX input and parses the DOM structure
- 🔍 Analyzes the depth of each element in the DOM tree
- 🌲 Converts the DOM structure into a **Binary Tree**
- 📉 Optimizes the DOM by **reducing depth** for better performance
- 📊 Provides insights and explanations for each DOM element
- 🖥️ **User-friendly UI** with scrollable output

## 📚 Technologies Used

- **Next.js** - Framework for React applications
- **TypeScript** - Strongly typed JavaScript
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling the UI
- **DOMParser** - Parsing HTML input
- **Binary Tree Algorithm** - Optimizing the DOM structure

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

This project is built using a combination of **Tree, Graph, and Stack data structures** to analyze and optimize the DOM structure efficiently.

### ⚡ Behind the Scenes (DSA Approach):
- 🌳 **Tree** - Uses a balanced tree to maintain the minimal depth of the DOM.
- 🔗 **Graph** - Uses **DFS (Depth-First Search)** to traverse all levels of the DOM depth and analyze it level-wise.
- 📦 **Stack** - Stores and maintains the hierarchical order for level-wise DOM analysis reports.

By optimizing the DOM structure, this tool helps improve performance and efficiency in web applications.

## 🔥 Why This Matters

Applying DSA skills to solve challenging problems by integrating them with development enhances confidence in tackling real-world scenarios effectively.
